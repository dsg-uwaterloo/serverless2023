<!--- # Workshop on Serverless Data Analytics 
## 1 September 2023, Vancouver, Canada
### (Co-located with VLDB 2023 Conference)
-->
Serverless computing has become popular with cloud providers because of its ease of use by application developers, its lightweight runtime, ease of maangement, resource elasticity and fine-grained billing. Adapting data analytics applications to serverless platforms pose new challenges. To maximize the benefits of serverless, the data analytics systems must be well designed, implemented, maintained, and optimized to efficiently process the massive amount of intermediate data, achieve the best possible job performance with a limited budget, minimize the cost without violating the QoS objective, etc. Recent work on serverless analytics has demonstrated the benefits of serverless architectures for resource- and cost-efficient data analytics. 

This workshop aims to focus on these problems, both from application development side and serverless system infrastructure side. It aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from data analytics and serverless computing communities to address the emerging need for serverless data analytic systems and applications. We welcome new ideas and critical research on Serverless Data Analytics as well as reports on best practices.

### Topics

The topics covered in the workshop include, but are not limited to:

* Serverless architecture for data analytics
* Task scheduling for serverless analytics
* Intermediate storage systems for serverless analytics
* Fine-grained resource allocation for serverless analytics
* High performance runtime for serverless analytics
* Query optimization in a serverless environment
* Data caching for serverless analytics

### Workshop Program

The workshop will have one keynote and 3-4 accepted papers with sufficient time for discussions.

Keynote Speaker: Gustavo Alonso, ETH Zürich


### Paper Submission & Evaluation 

Paper submission is to be done through CMT at the following site: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SDA2023" target="_blank">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SDA2023</a>

All papers will be peer reviewed by the Program Committee. The submitted papers should not have been previously published or concurrently under consideration. Work-in-progress papers that are shorter in length are acceptable and encouraged. The workshop will be in-person and one author of each paper is required to register.

Regular papers are 12 pages (excluding references); shorter, work-in-progress papers are limited to 6 pages (excluding references). PVLDB formatting guidelines and styles apply.
